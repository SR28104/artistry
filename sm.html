            Looking through most art history textbooks, you’ll be hard-pressed to find many references to female artists. Yet, since the mid 20th century, this has been changing.
            <br> Today we’re going to explore the realms of feminist art history, as well as discover ten feminist artists who paved the way for one of the most powerful <mark>art movements</mark></br>
             throughout history, one that would challenge the status quo and reshape the production and reception of <mark>contemporary art</mark>.</p>       
        <h3>WHAT IS FEMINISM?</h3>
        <p>Broadly speaking, feminism encompasses a range of ideologies that seek to establish the <u>equality of the sexes</u>. Beginning with <b>first-wave feminism</b> in the late 19th century, <br>it became the first real political movement for women, famously focusing on women’s right to vote. </br></p>
        <p>The 1960s and 70s saw the so-called <b>second wave of feminism:</b> whilst building on the first wave, the movement went one step further. Its followers aimed to question <br>traditional family roles, women’s place in institutions, and fight against the oppression of women around the world. Thanks to the institutional success  of the movement,</br>
            women reaped the benefits of increasingly gaining more rights and power going into the 1990s. </p>
        <p>With <b>third-wave feminism</b>, women wanted to choose how they lived, identified, presented themselves, and experienced full individuality. It was a <u>new era for women</u> and <br>gave them a chance to reclaim themselves and their lives moving forward.</br> </p>   
        <p><i>“A woman is the full circle. Within her is the power to create, nurture, and transform.”</i>
           <br>                 ~Diane Mariechild, author</p>
        <h3>FEMINIST ART HISTORY</h3>
        <p>A relatively new concept in the field of art history, feminist art as a movement only came into fruition in the 1960s and 1970s. Many women who saw themselves as feminists,<br> set out to build a body of work that challenged the <em>patriarchal status quo </em>in the art world.</br> </p>
        <p>Whilst many great female painters had come before, the feminist art movement of this era was born out of this massive cultural upheaval of the time. Not only were there civil<br> rights, anti-war and feminist movements, but there was also sexual liberation, political assassinations, and a new wave of music. Furthermore, the American art historian, Linda’s</br> Nochlin’s essay <i>Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?</i> (1971) encouraged a fundamental shift, highlighting and criticizing the circumstances that prohibited women<br> from achieving the same status as their male counterparts. </p>     
        <p><strike>These social movements, the political climate, and academic writings all helped to set the scene for a new artistic movement, which fought to express the feminine experience freely.</strike></p>    
        <h3>SOME FEMALE ARTISTS</h3>
        <h4>1. Georgia O’Keeffe </h4>
        <p>
            Recognized as the “Mother of American modernism”, and the foremother of the feminist art movement, <kbd>Georgia O’Keeffe</kbd> (1887-1986) was an American modernist artist. She is<br> known primarily for her paintings of enlarged flowers,<abbr title="New York">NY</abbr>  skyscrapers, and New Mexico landscapes. She littered her work with references to the female form. For example,</br> her flower paintings became famous for their curves, folds, interiors, layers, and darknesses. She stood up for female artists in the early 20th century, paving the way for the feminist <br>artists of the 1960s and 70s.

        <h4>2. Frida Kahlo </h4>
        <p>
            Mexican artist <kbd>Frida Kahlo</kbd> (1907-1954) is celebrated for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by nature and objects native to Mexico. Considered by many as one <br>of the most revolutionary female artists of all time, she broke with many social conventions. Rather than appearing like a typical woman, she assumed a more masculine appearance</br> through her clothing choices, wild hair, and unplucked eyebrows. She presented this female defiance in many of her self-portraits. Not only this, but her paintings explored many <br>female issues such as abortion, miscarriage, birth, breastfeeding, and more.
